## Methods {.page_break_before}

### Sample preparation

- Mice were anesthesized
- Mice were decapitated
- Mouse skulls were stored in EMA
- Separated into 4 batches of approximately 110 animals, labeled as B`batch_number`_`animal number`A and B`batch_number`_`animal number`B.

### Tomographic imaging

- SkyScan 1272 with sample changer
- *All* log files available here: https://github.unibe.ch/david-haberthuer/InMice/tree/main/logfiles
- Report scaning settings and reconstruction parameter data according to [@doi:10.1016/j.tmater.2023.100015]
- Use a notebook to pull *all* the relevant data to report directly into the text here, or into a file that is loaded by `manubot`.

### QA

- Use a collection of logfile wrangling code [@doi:10.5281/zenodo.15607944] to go through *all* the log files of all the aquired scans
    - Use this to surface issues related to aquisition (wrong setting) and reconstruction
- Look at average and maximal brightness of (a subset of) all the projection images aquired
    - Use this to surface issues related to acquisiton, e.g. sometimes the x-ray source inadvertedly shut down, or the counts were too low on the camera, etc.

### Image processing

- *Jupyter* [@https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/403913] notebooks, available here: https://github.unibe.ch/david-haberthuer/InMice/, for reproducible research.
