## Methods {.page_break_before}

### Sample preparation

- Mice were euthanized and decapitated
- Mouse skulls were stored in EMA
- Separated into 4 batches of approximately 110 animals, labeled as B`batch_number`_`animal number`A and B`batch_number`_`animal number`B.

### Tomographic imaging

- SkyScan 1272 with sample changer
- _All_ log files available here: https://github.unibe.ch/david-haberthuer/InMice/tree/main/logfiles
- Report scaning settings and reconstruction parameter data according to [@doi:10.1016/j.tmater.2023.100015]
- Use a notebook to pull _all_ the relevant data to report directly into the text here, or into a file that is loaded by `manubot`.

### QA

- Use a collection of logfile wrangling code [@doi:10.5281/zenodo.15607944] to go through _all_ the log files of all the aquired scans
  - Use this to surface issues related to aquisition (wrong setting) and reconstruction
- Look at average and maximal brightness of (a subset of) all the projection images aquired
  - Use this to surface issues related to acquisiton, e.g. sometimes the x-ray source inadvertedly shut down, or the counts were too low on the camera, etc.

### Image processing

- `Jupyter` [@https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/403913] notebooks, available here: https://github.unibe.ch/david-haberthuer/InMice/, for reproducible research.
  - Ingest complete, uncropped reconstructions with `dask` [@url:https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/]
  - Crop, based on axial MIPs
  - Save cropped data out as `.zarr`-files, ready to be loaded with `n5-ij` [@url:https://github.com/saalfeldlab/n5-ij] in Fiji [@doi:10.1038/nmeth.2019]
  - Save in other formats, to either use 3D Slicer [@url:https://www.slicer.org/;@doi:10.1016/j.mri.2012.05.001] or Dragonfly [@url:https://dragonfly.comet.tech/]
