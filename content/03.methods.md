### Tomographic imaging

- SkyScan 1272 with sample changer
- *All* log files available here: https://github.unibe.ch/david-haberthuer/InMice/tree/main/logfiles
- Report scaning settings and reconstruction parameter data according to [@doi:10.1016/j.tmater.2023.100015]
- Use a notebook to pull *all* the relevant data to report directly into the text here, or into a file that is loaded by `manubot`.

### Image processing

- *Jupyter* [@https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/403913] notebooks, available here: https://github.unibe.ch/david-haberthuer/InMice/, for reproducible research.
